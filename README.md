# About Outpost31

Outpost31 is a class library that provides the back-end functionality for the [Tingen Web Service](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/tingen-web-service).

Since the majority of Outpost31 development is done in the Tingen Web Service, you'll find all [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/tingen-web-service/blob/development/CHANGELOG.md) and [ROADMAP](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/tingen-web-service/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) information there.

## Why this repository is here

This repository is public because I think it's important to make the source code available for everyone to see.
