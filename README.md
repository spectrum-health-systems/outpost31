> HI THERE!  
>
> This is the **development version** of Outpost31, and actually doesn't do anything on it's own.

# About Outpost31

Outpost31 contains the core and module functionality for [Tingen](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen).

The Outpost31 repository is:

* A ***development version***!
* ***Not intended*** to be used on it's own, or outside of Tingen!
* Most likely filled with ***bad/ugly/dumb placeholder code***!
* Only used by the ***developer(s)*** of Outpost31, ***for the development*** of Outpost31!

This repository is public because I think it's important to make the source code available for everyone to see.

# Repository branches

There are three types of branches in this repository:

* **[main](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Outpost31)**  
  This is about as "stable" as Outpost31 is going to get, and even then it is considered a development version, so ***don't use it in production environments***!

  The development branch is merged into main occasionally, generally for documentation updates, so commits to this branch are not a good indication of development progress.
  
* **[development](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Outpost31/tree/development)**  
  The majority of Outpost31 development is done in this branch, so if you want the latest-and-greatest, this is where to go.

  If you are curious as to what features/bugs/etc. are being worked on, [here you go](https://github.com/orgs/spectrum-health-systems/projects/41/views/1).

* **Outpost31 archive snapshots**  
  When development starts on a new monthly version, the previous version is archived to a separate branch (e.g., `24.9.0-development+final`).
